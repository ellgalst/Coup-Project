COUP Game Project
The COUP game project is a Java implementation of the popular card game COUP, where players bluff and use strategy to expose the influence of their opponents to win the game. Each player aims to be the last one standing by strategically using their role cards, which include characters like the Duke, Assassin, Captain, Ambassador, and Contessa.

Features
Five Unique Characters: Implement character-specific actions such as taxing, stealing, and assassinating.
Dynamic Interaction: Players can block actions based on their characters' abilities.
Automated Deck Management: Automatic shuffling and handling of the deck.
Game State Management: Tracks the state of the game, including player turns and remaining influences.
